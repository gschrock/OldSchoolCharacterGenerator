export const combatActions = `<strong>Attacking with Two Weapons:</strong> Characters with DEX or STR as a prime requisite may choose to wield two one-handed weapons, as follows:

<div style='padding: 0 1.5rem'>• The secondary weapon must be of small size (e.g. a dagger or hand axe).

• Attacks with the pimary weapon suffer a -2 penalty.

• The character may make one extra attack per round with the secondary weapon, at a -4 penalty.
</div>

<strong>Charging into Melee:</strong> Once per combat, a character may charge into melee and attack, as follows:

<div style='padding: 0 1.5rem'>• The character moves their complete encounter movement rate before attacking. There must be a clear run.

• The character gains a +2 bonus to attack this round.

• Weapons that may be braced against charging monsters are also effective against charging characters.
</div>

<strong>Missile Attacks on Targets in Melee:</strong> The constant and unpredictable movement of characters in melee makes firing or throwing missile weapons at combatants an uncertain proposition.

When this happens, randomly determine which character in the melee is actually targeted by the missile attack, before making the attack roll.

Typically, all characters involved in the melee have the same chance of being targeted, but especially large creatures may count as two or more characters.

<strong>Parrying:</strong> Characters with a STR of 13 or above may opt to act purely defensively in melee, forfeiting their attack that round. When parrying, the character's STR bonus to melee attacks is aplied as an armor class bonus that round.

<strong>Splash Weapons:</strong>
<div style='padding: 0 1.5rem'>
<strong>Targeting a Surface:</strong> Characters may attempt to throw a splash weapon so that it smashes on a hard surface close to one or more creatures. This is handled as an attack against AC 11. If the attack succeeds, all creatures within 5' are splashed with the liquid and, if it is harmful to them, suffer 1d2 damage.

<strong>Misses:</strong> When an attack with a splash weapon misses its target (whether a character or a surface), it lands in a random location:
<div style='padding: 0 1.5rem'>
• Roll 1d12 to determine the direction, interpreting the roll as a clock-face direction.

• The container smashes 5' away from the intended target in the specified direction.

• Creatures within 5' of this location are splashed with the liquid. If it is harmful to them, they suffer 1d2 damage.
