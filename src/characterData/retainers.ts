export const retainers = `<strong>Retainers:</strong> Retainers are NPCs that are hired by characters to accompany them on an adventure. (NPCs hired for non-adventuring tasks are treated as hirelings, see <i>Core Rules, p18</i>.)

<strong>Limit per PC:</strong> Each character is limited to a finite number of retainers, which is indicated by the character’s Charisma score (see <i>Core Rules Ability Scores, p14</i>).

<strong>Duties:</strong> Retainers are not mindless slaves and, although they will usually share the party’s risks, they will not willingly act as battle fodder. If abused in any way, retainers will typically warn others of this and the PCs will soon find it difficult to hire other retainers.

<strong>Class and Level:</strong> Retainers can be of any class (including normal humans of level 0), but must be of equal or lower level to the hiring PC.

<strong>Recruitment:</strong> Retainers may be located by frequenting drinking establishments or by paying to post notices of help wanted.

<strong>Standard Rate:</strong> Retainers will usually want a guaranteed fee (per day or per adventure) and a share of treasure recovered (at very least a half share). For example: a fee of 1gp per day plus a half share of treasure.

<strong>Upkeep:</strong> The hiring PC must also pay for the retainer’s daily upkeep (food and lodgings) and for any new adventuring gear, weapons, or mounts the retainer requires.

<strong>Shares of Treasure:</strong> Fractional shares of treasure are calculated by dividing the treasure by the total number of shares. For example, a party consisting of 5 PCs (who receive full shares) plus one retainer (who is paid a half share) discover 2,750gp of treasure. The total is divided by 5.5 (five full shares plus one half share): 500gp. Thus, each PC gains 500gp and the retainer gains 250gp.

<strong>Loyalty:</strong> Retainers have a loyalty rating, determined by the hiring character’s CHA (see <i>Core Rules Ability Scores, p14</i>). This rating may be adjusted at the DM’s discretion:
<div style='padding: 0 1.5rem'>
• <strong>Bonuses:</strong> A retainer’s loyalty may be increased if the PC has been particularly good to the retainer (e.g. has repeatedly given additional treasure).

• <strong>Penalties:</strong> A retainer’s loyalty may be reduced if the PC has been cruel or contrary to their word.
</div>

<strong>Loyalty Checks:</strong> To make a loyalty check, the DM rolls 2d6 and, if the result is lower than or equal to the retainer’s loyalty rating, accounting for any adjustments, the roll has succeeded.

<strong>When to Check Loyalty:</strong> Loyalty checks are made in two circumstances:
<div style='padding: 0 1.5rem'>
• <strong>Peril:</strong> Each time the retainer is exposed to a particularly perilous situation. If the roll fails, the retainer will likely flee. 

• <strong>After an adventure:</strong> If the roll fails, the retainer will not work for the PC again.
