export const gainingXPAndCarousing = `<strong>XP Awards:</strong> All characters who return from an adventure alive receive experience points (XP). XP is gained from three sources: treasure recovered, monsters defeated, and successful trips to the Barrowmoore (+50 xp for each trip, with DM discretion).</strong>

<strong>Treasure:</strong>
<div style='padding: 0 1.5rem'>
<strong>Non-magical treasure:</strong> Characters gain 1 XP per 1 gold piece (gp) value of the treasure when returned to a safe location (e.g. town).

<strong>Magical treasure:</strong> Does not grant XP.
</div>

<strong>Defeated Monsters:</strong> All monsters defeated by the party (i.e. slain, outsmarted, captured, scared away, etc.) grant XP based on how powerful they are (DM determines this value).

<strong>Carousing:</strong> Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, binge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps them cope with the perils they face on their adventures. Under these rules once per session a character may spend up to 600 gp on these activities, gaining experience points equal to the amount spent. <strong>In all cases carousers must save versus poison to avoid over-indulgence in their vices.</strong> Failure necessitates a roll by the DM to see what trouble the character has gotten into. A carouser also makes a charisma roll to see if they have made any new allies or enemies.`;
