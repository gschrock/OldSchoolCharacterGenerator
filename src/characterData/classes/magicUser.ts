    "Combat: Magic-users may only use daggers and are unable to use shields or wear any kind of armour. For this reason, magic-users are weak at low levels and, in an adventuring group, should be protected.",
    "Magical Research: A magic-user of any level may spend time and money to research new spells to add to his or her spell book. When a magic-user reaches 9th level, he or she is also able to create magic items and research other magical effects. These rules are detailed in the Magic section of B/X Essentials: Core Rules.",
    "Using Magic Items: As spell casters, magic-users are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. There are also items (e.g. magic wands) that may only be used by magic-users or elves.",
    "Read Magic: By means of read magic, the caster can decipher magical inscriptions or runes.\n  The magical script of a scroll of arcane spells can be understood. The caster is then able to activate the scroll at any time in the future.\n  A spell book written by another arcane spell caster can be deciphered.\n  Runes or magical words inscribed on an object or surface can be understood.\nOnce the caster has read a magical inscription using read magic, he or she is thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of this spell."
