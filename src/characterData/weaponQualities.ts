export const weaponQualities = `<strong>Usage Die:</strong> Consumables such as a quiver of arrows, case of bolts etc. have an assigned size of die (d4, d6, d8 etc.). Each time you would use this type of consumable, roll the assigned size of die. If it comes up 3 or higher you get the use successfully. If it comes up 1 or 2 you get the use successfully, but next time you use the next smaller die size (d20 -> d12 -> d10 -> d8 -> d6 -> d4). Rolling a 1 or 2 on a d4 means you get a successful use but subsequently run out of that consumable item.

<strong>Blunt:</strong> May be used by clerics.  

<strong>Brace:</strong> When braced against the ground, doubles damage against charging monsters.

<strong>Charge:</strong> On horseback, moving at least 60’ in a round and attacking doubles any damage done with a successful hit.  

<strong>Melee:</strong> Close quarters weapon (5’ or less).  

<strong>Missile:</strong> Thrown or fired weapon (greater than 5’ distance). The distances for short (+1 to hit), medium, and long (-1 to hit) range are shown in parentheses.    

<strong>Slow:</strong> The character acts last in each combat round (see <i>Basic Combat Procedure in B/X Essentials: Core Rules</i>).  

<strong>Splash weapon:</strong> On a successful missile attack, the container smashes and the target is doused in the liquid. Damage is inflicted over two rounds, as the liquid drips off.   

<strong>Two-handed:</strong> The weapon requires both hands; the character cannot use a shield.`;
